# TINUIORegistry
A Swift library to access information from the IORegistry.

# Features and usage

To be added.

# Who should use this Library?

This library should be used by swift apps/programs for macOS that needs to retrive information from the IORegistry.

This code is intended for macOS only since it requires the system library 'IOKit'.

# About the project

This code was created for of my [TINU project](https://github.com/ITzTravelInTime/TINU) and it has been made into it's own library to make the main project's source less complex and more focused on it's aim. 

Also having this as it's own library allows for code to be updated separately and so various versions of the main TINU app will be able to be compiled all with the latest version of this library.
